# Metal Java Solid: Space Eater

## Project Description

**METAL JAVA SOLID: SPACE EATER** is a 2D videogame project written in Java that I am currently working on. It's a fork from another team project in which I took part in my 4th week @ <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #74 Bootcamp in Oporto.
We were challenged to create a game applying the technologies we had learned the previous weeks. Deadline for project deployment: 10 nights!
New features are being developed and the whole game is being redesigned. Since it's taking a different direction from the original intention I decided to rename it also. The original game title was "Orange Sunrise Spaceships Fight".

## The Idea

A Two player game in space where two spaceships engage in combat.

## Development

After some brainstorming sessions we designed the UML schema for our project considering all our game's main features, technologies, tools and libraries adopted. We implemented features one by one (movement, collision detectors, audio effects, graphic elements, basic UI/UX) mainly in pair programming, with extra details being coded individually.

## Tech and Resources

Java 8 | OOP | Simple Graphics Library with Keyboard Events | IntelliJ IDEA | Apache Ant | Canva.com | freesound.org | freesoundslibrary.com | pixabay.com

## "Kept you waiting huh?" ðŸ˜Ž

Given the forked version title of this game, "Metal Java Solid: Space Eater", can you guess which is my favorite video game franchise of all time?
